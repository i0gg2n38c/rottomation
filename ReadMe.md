# Rottomation
Rottomation is a Ruby on Rails Web Application Testing Framework that is VERY early in development.

This will provide the scaffolding for doing API and Frontend testing.

- API using a Service architecture with -> Request Builder pattern and approach, using http/request for the final API call handling

- Frontend testing is handled via Selenium, with wrapper methods around frequently used methods, with explicit handling to reduce common flukes


## Very Rough. Don't use in a real project if you stumble into this for some reason. It is not ready for real work at this juncture.
